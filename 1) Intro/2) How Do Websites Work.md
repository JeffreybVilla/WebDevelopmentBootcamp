### Google Website Example
- First we receive these files from the Google server.
- When our browser loads up the HTML files, we'll get to see the structure of the website. 
  - 1 image (Google Logo)
  - 2 buttons
  - 1 Text box
- Then we receive the CSS files.
  - This modifies the appearance of all of those components.
- Then with the javascript files the website has the functionality to do the search.
