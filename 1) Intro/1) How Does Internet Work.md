# What is the Internet?
- A long piece of wire that connects different computers to each other.
    - You could have 1 computer in London, another computer it Seattle.
    - The computers can talk to each other and transfer data through the wire. 
### Web Server Computers
- Some of the computers attatched to the internet have a special job.
    - Servers must be online 24/7, ready to serve you all the data and the files you are requesting when trying to access websites. 
- Think of them as giant libraries that are always open.
- You can request to see Google's homepage at any time, facebook, it's always available.
- It is able to serve you all of the files and data you would need to be able to view the website.
    
### Client Computers
- The computers that any user would use to access the internet.

### The Process
1) You request to view www.Google.com.
2) Your Web browser will send a message to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (Comcast) saying you want to see Google.com.
3) Your ISP will then relay that message to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
4) The DNS server will look up in its database to see what is the exact IP address of that website you are trying to access. 
    -Every single computer that's connected to the internet has an IP address. (The address location of your computer) 
    -When people need to send & receive files on the internet, each computer can be located by their unique IP address.
5) Once the DNS server finds the IP address, it sends that back to your browser.
    - Now you know the exact address where you can find the Google homepage.
6) Next, you will send a direct request to that address through your ISP.
    - This request will be delivered via the "Internet Backbone".
    - These are the underwater cables that power the internet. 
    - The internet is made up of these HUGE masses of wires that connect all of the world's internet users.
    - If I'm in United States and I want to see a website that's hosted in London, my browser would have to make a request that goes through one of these cables under the Atlantic ocean in order to reach London.
    - Once the other computer has received my request, they will send back all the relevant data back through these cables.
